these are the things i did
the first 3 pages were made on Day 1 rebranding issue.
on Day 1 Brand Swap, i designed the first 3 pages,
on Day 2 brad swap, i extended the swapped brand following the same visual style and feel connected to the brand created on Day 1.

i added three new screens.
these screens are the Cart page, Explore page, and Profile page.

the Cart page shows selected food items and order details.
the Explore page helps users search and view restaurants and food items.
the Profile page shows user information, wallet balance, and settings.
all screens follow the same style and design.
