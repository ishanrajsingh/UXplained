DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN :-

Design Approach

The design follows a user-first, problem-driven approach focused on clarity, consistency, and minimal cognitive load. Each interaction is intentionally simple to help users complete tasks quickly without confusion.

Screens Chosen

Only essential screens were selected to support the core user journey and reduce unnecessary navigation. Each screen serves a clear purpose, ensuring a smooth and logical flow from start to finish.

UI/UX Laws Applied

Key UI/UX laws were applied to enhance usability, including visual hierarchy for focus, proximity for grouping related elements, and consistency to improve learnability. These principles ensure the interface feels intuitive and predictable.
