Explanation :
The law of proximity says that elements placed close to each other are preceived to be related
while the ones that are placed apart seem to be unrelated .
In this design i tried to demonstrate this law by creating a shop menu with various items
in the first group the items are placed randomly and items placed together are not necessarily related which creates confusion in the mind of the user
while in the second group the items are placed in groups with headings which helps the user easily find desired items!!!!
